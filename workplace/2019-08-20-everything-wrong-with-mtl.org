hi, question, can we gather here the list of all the issues with the MTL way of writing software, i’ll later take that list and build a bigger example showing all those issues and then magically show how polysemy solves it all :slightly_smiling_face:
so far this is what I’ve got:.
- I can not have `MonadError MyAppError m, MonadError SomeOtherError m`
- at the end of the world I’m still stuck with monad transformers, I need to eventualy have ExceptT StateT ReaderT stack one on top of the other (if for example I want to manage state from IORef I’m screwed. Or for example if ReaderT was giving me some configuration, maybe i want to read that config from system variables. But I’m stuck with the monad stack :) (edited)

^^ the above is from my personal experience, but you were mentioning other issues if I recall

correct

rabbit [10:32 AM]
so is that all issues or are there more that i’m not aware of ?
- the other thing will be testing this whole thing, right? it seems that i might get stuck with production instances for my code

isovector [2:31 PM]
also correct
and decomposability
it's not very feasible to decompose an effect into other effects
in mtl

right, cool, thx
